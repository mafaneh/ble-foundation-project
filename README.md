## "BLE Playground" Project for the Bluetooth Developer Academy

This serves as a playground for developing various BLE features on various platforms.

To follow along with the progress, tutorials, and more information on the different features implemented, check out the [Bluetooth Developer Academy](https://novelbits.io/academy).

### First Stage:
#### 1. Implement a BLE Peripheral on a nRF52840 DK using nRF Connect SDK.

Current Status:
- Implemented LED Service (using LED #3 on the DK) to allow turning on/off the LED and reading its current status

#### 2. Implement a BLE Central on a nRF52840 DK using nRF Connect SDK. Features TBD.
